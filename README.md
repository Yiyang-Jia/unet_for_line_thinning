## Machine learning class project: processing experimental figures using neural networks (done in collaboration with Zhaoyu Bai and Yaozhang Zhou)

Goal: automate the ploting of Streda lines (associated with quantum Hall effect) from dirty experimental figures.

A typical pre-processed experimental figure looks like (taken from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04002-3)

 and its post-propcessed plot (ground truth) looks like
